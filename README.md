# OpenTronsSimulation
Simulating OpenTrons equipment to learn the basics of liquid handler programming

## Environment
Using [OpenTrons](https://www.opentrons.com/) App since it is open source and free to use.

I will be using their [Python API](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/) (specifically version 2) along with a simulated version of the machine OT-2 to verify my protocols, as described in [this guide](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/2741869-simulating-ot-2-protocols-on-your-computer).

My Python environment is Python 3.7.3, run in a jupyter notebook. 

For the magnetic plate, OT-2 uses an accessory that brings magnets close or far to the plate without moving it. More info about [Magnetic Module](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/1820112-magnetic-module).

To include custom labware in simulation, I followed this guide on [Loading custom labware](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols).
