# OpenTronsSimulation
Simulating OpenTrons equipment to learn the basics of liquid handler programming

## Environment
Using [OpenTrons](https://www.opentrons.com/) App since it is open source and free to use.

I will be using their [Python API](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/) (specifically version 2) along with a simulated version of the machine OT-2 to verify my protocols, as described in [this guide](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/2741869-simulating-ot-2-protocols-on-your-computer).

My Python environment is Python 3.7.3, run in a jupyter notebook.
